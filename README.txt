ObjectQuery enables you to query for persistent objects (e.g. objects in the
ZODB). This is done with a XPath-like language named Regular Path Expressions
(RPE). Please refer src/gocept/objectquery/pathexpressions.txt for information
about the syntax. ObjectQuery also comes with indexstructures for performance
reasons.

It uses SimpleParse to parse the RPE-query.
